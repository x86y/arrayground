A (mostly) SwiftUI application to interface with CBQN and ngn/k libraries into a (mostly) working repl.
</p>

Features:
- ngn/k support
- bqnlibs shipped out of the box
- BQN support (custom keyboard shipped with the app, \KEY combination also works for transliteration)
- Use the `\, NAME` command to create or switch between different buffers, and the `\,l` command to list all available buffers.
- Select between k/bqn and color themes by typing `config`
- Type `\\:` to see all k help pages and `\:`, `\h`, `\'`, <code>\\\`</code>, `\+` to see the single help pages

WIP/Feature list:
- Always blinking cursor on the main input
- Better BQN keyboard design
- Http client capabilities
- Explore more native API's
- Sliding through the buffers with gestures
