/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to create a keyboard that is
 using a `SystemKeyboard` to mimic a native Unicode keyboard.

 This class inherits ``DemoKeyboardViewController`` and only
 makes unicode-related changes to the standard configuration.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.

 Note that this demo adds KeyboardKit as a local package, to
 make it easy to test and develop the library from this demo.

     Here, we register demo-specific services which are then
     used by the keyboard.

    override func viewDidLoad() {

        // Setup a demo-specific Unicode input set provider.
        // ðŸ’¡ You can change this provider to see how the keyboard layout changes.

        // Call super to perform the base initialization
