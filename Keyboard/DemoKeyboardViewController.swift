 This base keyboard view controller is inherited by all demo
 ``KeyboardViewController`` classes in this project.

 The class sets up a foundation for a KeyboardKit-based demo
 keyboard, with demo-specific configurations, then sets up a
 ``KeyboardView`` that has a `SystemKeyboard`-based keyboard.
 You can change all these configurations at any time, to see
 how the keyboard changes.
